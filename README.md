Introduction

The project “Smart Cell Retail Software” is a total package for a cell phone store,
 which aims at decreasing the burden of employees at retail stores and automates their
 most of the work. As retail stores now-a-days have huge number of devices and 
 accessories to deal with, in addition to it they also have to interact and manage their
 customers.
   Maintaining such huge records and regularly updating it on paper is very incommodious task.
In paper-based work employees in store are required to manually evaluate the stock inlet and outlet,
 gross income, as well as maintain their customer’s information, arrears or advances payments, etc. 
 Even after managing such unhandy data, employees frequently encounter situations where the data
 available with them is inconsistent. 
For handling burden of the employees at retail stores, we present a desktop based application built
 on top of Java that will solve all the problems and make them more productive by saving their time
 that was earlier misspent in managing the data and will therefore enhance employees’ day to day 
 experience of handling their customers much more efficiently.
